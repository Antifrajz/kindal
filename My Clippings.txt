A foundation for our answer can be found in a warning provided by the late communication theorist and New York University professor Neil Postman.

We were, he noted, no longer discussing the trade-offs surrounding new technologies, balancing the new efficiencies against the new problems introduced. If it’s high-tech, we began to instead assume, then it’s good. Case closed.

One place where this strategy becomes particularly difficult outside work is when you’re forced to wait (for example, standing in line at a store). It’s crucial in these situations that if you’re in an offline block, you simply gird yourself for the temporary boredom, and fight through it with only the company of your thoughts. To simply wait and be bored has become a novel experience in modern life, but from the perspective of concentration training, it’s incredibly valuable.

This rule attempts to break us out of this rut by proposing a third option: accepting that these tools are not inherently evil, and that some of them might be quite vital to your success and happiness, but at the same time also accepting that the threshold for allowing a site regular access to your time and attention (not to mention personal data) should be much more stringent, and that most people should therefore be using many fewer such tools. I won’t ask you, in other words, to quit the Internet altogether like Baratunde Thurston did for twenty-five days back in 2013. But I will ask you to reject the state of distracted hyperconnectedness that drove him to that drastic experiment in the first place.

Fortunately, Arnold Bennett identified the solution to this problem a hundred years earlier: Put more thought into your leisure time . In other words, this strategy suggests that when it comes to your relaxation, don’t default to whatever catches your attention at the moment, but instead dedicate some advance thinking to the question of how you want to spend your “day within a day.” Addictive websites of the type mentioned previously thrive in a vacuum: If you haven’t given yourself something to do in a given moment, they’ll always beckon as an appealing option. If you instead fill this free time with something of more quality, their grip on your attention will loosen.

The deep life, of course, is not for everybody. It requires hard work and drastic changes to your habits. For many, there’s a comfort in the artificial busyness of rapid e-mail messaging and social media posturing, while the deep life demands that you leave much of that behind. There’s also an uneasiness that surrounds any effort to produce the best things you’re capable of producing, as this forces you to confront the possibility that your best is not (yet) that good. It’s safer to comment on our culture than to step into the Rooseveltian ring and attempt to wrestle it into something better. But if you’re willing to sidestep these comforts and

Certain that stocks would eventually rebound, I kept buying them, even as the market fell and I lost money until I figured out what was going wrong and how to deal with it. I gradually learned that prices reflect people’s expectations, so they go up when actual results are better than expected and they go down when they are worse than expected. And most people tend to be biased by their recent experiences. That fall, I started at a local college, C. W. Post. I got

To try to understand what was happening, I spent the rest of that summer studying past currency devaluations. I learned that everything that was going on—the currency breaking its link to gold and devaluing, the stock market soaring in response—had happened before, and that logical cause-effect relationships made those developments inevitable. My failure to anticipate this, I realized, was due to my being surprised by something that hadn’t happened in my lifetime, though it had happened many times before. The message that reality was conveying to me was “You better make sense of what happened to other people in other times and other places because if you don’t you won’t know if these things can happen to you and, if they do, you won’t know how to deal with them.”

The lesson? When everybody thinks the same thing—such as what a sure bet the Nifty 50 is—it is almost certainly reflected in the price, and betting on it is probably going to be a mistake. I also learned that for every action (such as easy money and credit) there is a consequence (in this case, higher inflation) roughly proportionate to that action, which causes an approximately equal and opposite reaction (tightening of money and credit) and market reversals. I was beginning to see things

My final lesson was perhaps the most important one, because it has applied again and again throughout my life. At first, it seemed to me that I faced an all-or-nothing choice: I could either take on a lot of risk in pursuit of high returns (and occasionally find myself ruined) or I could lower my risk and settle for lower returns. But I needed to have both low risk and high returns, and by setting out on a mission to discover how I could, I learned to go slowly when faced with the choice between two things that you need that are seemingly at odds. That way you can figure out how to have as much of both as possible. There is almost always a good path that you just haven’t discovered yet, so look for it until you find it rather than settle for the choice that is then apparent to you.

Successful people are those who can go above themselves to see things objectively and manage those things to shape change. They can take in the perspectives of others instead of being trapped in their own heads with their own biases. They are able to look objectively at what they are like—their strengths and weaknesses—and what others are like to put the right people in the right roles to achieve their goals.

If you can do those five things well, you will almost certainly be successful. Here they are in a nutshell: 1. Have clear goals. 2. Identify and don’t tolerate the problems that stand in the way of your achieving those goals. 3. Accurately diagnose the problems to get at their root causes. 4.

wonderful thinking available to them. As a result, they continually run toward what they see and keep crashing into what they are blind to until the crashing leads them to adapt. Those who adapt do so by a) teaching their brains to work in a way that doesn’t come naturally (the creative person learns to become organized through discipline and practice, for instance), b) using compensating mechanisms (such as programmed reminders), and/or c) relying on the help of others who are strong where they are weak.

For me, there is really only one big choice to make in life: Are you willing to fight to find out what’s true? Do you deeply believe that finding out what is true is essential to your well-being? Do you have a genuine need to find out if you or others are doing something wrong that is standing in the way of achieving your goals? If your answer to any of these questions is no, accept that you will never live up to your potential. If, on the other hand, you are up for the challenge of becoming radically open-minded, the first step in doing so is to look at yourself objectively.

Introversion vs. extroversion. Introverts focus on the inner world and get their energy from ideas, memories, and experiences while extroverts are externally focused and get their energy from being with people. Introversion and extroversion are also linked to differences in communication styles. If you have a friend who loves to “talk out” ideas (and even has trouble thinking through something if there isn’t someone around to work it through with), he or she is likely an extrovert. Introverts will usually find such conversations painful, preferring to think privately and share only after they’ve worked things out on their own. I’ve found that it is important to help each communicate in the way that they feel most comfortable. For example, introverts often prefer communicating in writing (such as email) rather than speaking in group settings and tend to be less open with their critical thoughts.

If a man never discovers his deepest purpose, or if he permanently compromises it and uses his family as an excuse for doing so, then his core becomes weakened and he loses depth and presence. His woman loses trust and sexual polarity with him, even though he may be putting much energy into parenting their children and doing the housework. A man should, of course, be a full participant in caring for children and the household. But if he gives up his deepest purpose to do so, ultimately, everyone suffers.

A woman often seems to test her man’s capacity to remain unperturbed in his truth and purpose. She tests him to feel his freedom and depth of love, to know that he is trustable. Her tests may come in the form of complaining, challenging him, changing her mind, doubting him, distracting him, or even undermining his purpose in a subtle or not so subtle way. A man should never think his woman’s testing is going to end and his life will get easier. Rather, he should appreciate that she does these things to feel his strength, integrity, and openness. Her desire is for his deepest truth and love. As he grows, so will her testing.

Why is she being this way? Because she simply wants to deflate your success? No. She is challenging you because your success doesn’t mean shit to her, unless you are free and loving. And if you are free and loving, nothing she says can collapse you. She wants to feel you are uncollapsable, so she pokes you in your weak spot.

There is a specific exercise you can perform throughout sex and also during the approach to orgasm. By doing this exercise you will convert the direction of the orgasm, so instead of ejaculating out your penis, you will “ejaculate” up your spine, experiencing intense bodily bliss and emotional openness, far beyond the quick pleasure and depleted peace following an ejaculative orgasm.

Austerity means to eliminate the comforts and cushions in your life that you have learned to snuggle into and lose wakefulness. Take away anything that dulls your edge. No newspapers or magazines. No TV. No candy, cookies, or sweets. No sex. No cuddling. No reading of anything at all while you eat or sit on the toilet. Reduce working time to a necessary minimum. No movies. No conversation that isn’t about truth, love, or the divine.

They have lost sight of how bad things have become because they have gotten used to it. 4. They have such high pride in their work (or such large egos) that they can’t bear to admit they are unable to solve their own problems. 5. They fear adverse consequences from admitting failure.

There’s a principle called Parkinson’s Law—work expands to whatever time you give it. So give your workday a deadline. A deadline is important for stamina and mental health.

Instead, taking a bubble bath or going on a leisurely walk are good examples of rewarding yourself with free time, which aligns with your ultimate goal of more freedom and financial independence. Similarly, if your reward for exercising is eating a bowl of ice cream, then you’re casting votes for conflicting identities, and it ends up being a wash. Instead, maybe your reward is a massage, which is both a luxury and a vote toward taking care of your body. Now the short-term reward is aligned with your long-term vision of being a healthy person.

“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. Don’t break the chain of sales calls and you’ll build a successful book of business. Don’t break the chain of workouts and you’ll get fit faster than you’d expect. Don’t break the chain of creating every day and you will end up with an impressive portfolio. Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.

Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted view of our own behavior. We think we act better than we do. Measurement offers one way to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really going on each day. One glance at the paper clips in the container and you immediately know how much work you have (or haven’t) been putting in. When the evidence is right in front of you, you’re less likely to lie to yourself.

The most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path. In this way, habit tracking can have an addictive effect on motivation. Each small win feeds your desire.

Furthermore, it’s not always about what happens during the workout. It’s about being the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts. It’s easy to train when you feel good, but it’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it—even if you do less than you hope. Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but it reaffirms your identity.

Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is painful. Pain is an effective teacher. If a failure is painful, it gets fixed. If a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it. The threat of a bad review forces a plumber to be good at his job. The possibility of a customer never returning makes restaurants create good food. The cost of cutting the wrong blood vessel makes a surgeon master human anatomy and cut carefully. When the consequences are severe, people learn quickly.

When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.

The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a serious match against a four-year-old, you will quickly become bored. It’s too easy. You’ll win every point. In contrast, if you play a professional tennis player like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, you will quickly lose motivation because the match is too difficult.

Now consider playing tennis against someone who is your equal. As the game progresses, you win a few points and you lose a few. You have a good chance of winning, but only if you really try. Your focus narrows, distractions fade away, and you find yourself fully invested in the task at hand. This is a challenge of just manageable difficulty and it is a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule.

Periodic reflection and review is like viewing yourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. You can see the important changes you should make without losing sight of the bigger picture.

The following quote from the Tao Te Ching encapsulates the ideas perfectly: Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail. —LAO TZU

New plans offer hope because we don’t have any experiences to ground our expectations. New strategies seem more appealing than old ones because they can have unbounded hope. As Aristotle noted, “Youth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.” Perhaps this can be revised to “Youth is easily deceived because it only hopes.” There is no experience to root the expectation in. In the beginning, hope is all you have.

The method by which DESIRE for riches can be transmuted into its financial equivalent consists of six definite, practical actions: First. Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire. It is not sufficient merely to say, “I want plenty of money.” Be definite as to the amount. (There is a psychological reason for definiteness which will be described in a subsequent chapter.) Second. Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money you desire. (There is no such reality as “something for nothing.”) Third. Establish a definite date when you intend to possess the money you desire. Fourth. Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into action. Fifth. Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money, and describe clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it. Sixth. Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before retiring at night and once after arising in the morning.

Self-Confidence Formula First. I know that I have the ability to achieve the object of my Definite Purpose in life; therefore, I DEMAND of myself persistent, continuous action toward its attainment, and I here and now promise to render such action. Second. I realize that the dominating thoughts of my mind will eventually reproduce themselves in outward, physical action, and gradually transform themselves into physical reality; therefore, I will concentrate my thoughts for 30 minutes daily upon the task of thinking of the person I intend to become, thereby creating in my mind a clear mental picture of that person. Third. I know that through the principle of autosuggestion any desire that I persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek expression through some practical means of attaining the object back of it; therefore, I will devote ten minutes daily to demanding of myself the development of SELF-CONFIDENCE. Fourth. I have clearly written down a description of my DEFINITE CHIEF AIM in life, and I will never stop trying until I shall have developed sufficient self-confidence for its attainment. 4 Fifth. I fully realize that no wealth or position can long endure unless built upon truth and justice; therefore, I will engage in no transaction that does not benefit all whom it affects. I will succeed by attracting to myself the forces I wish to use and the cooperation of other people. I will induce others to serve me because of my willingness to serve others. I will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism by developing love for all humanity—because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me because I will believe in them and in myself. Sixth. I will sign my name to this formula, commit it to memory, and repeat it aloud once a day, with full FAITH that it will gradually influence my THOUGHTS and ACTIONS so that I will become a self-reliant and successful person.

This idea of starting at the bottom and working one’s way up may appear to be sound, but the major objection to it is this—too many of those who begin at the bottom never manage to lift their heads high enough to be seen by OPPORTUNITY, so they remain at the bottom. It should be remembered also that the outlook from the bottom is not so very bright or encouraging. It has a tendency to kill off ambition. We call it “getting into a rut,” which means that we accept our fate because we form the HABIT of daily routine, a habit that finally becomes so strong we cease to try to throw it off. And that is another reason why it pays to start one or two steps above the bottom. By so doing, one forms the HABIT of looking around, of observing how others get ahead, of seeing OPPORTUNITY, and of embracing it without hesitation.

The starting point of all achievement is DESIRE. Keep this constantly in mind. Weak desires bring weak results, just as a small amount of fire makes a small amount of heat. If you find yourself lacking in persistence, this weakness may be remedied by building a stronger fire under your desires.

The Eight Factors of Persistence 1. DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. Knowing what one wants is the first and, perhaps, the most important step toward the development of persistence. A strong motive forces one to surmount many difficulties. 2. DESIRE. It is comparatively easy to acquire and to maintain persistence in pursuing the object of intense desire. 3. SELF-RELIANCE. Belief in one’s ability to carry out a plan encourages one to follow the plan through with persistence. (Self-reliance can be developed through the principle described in Chapter 3 on Autosuggestion.) 4. DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. Organized plans, even though they may be weak and entirely impractical, encourage persistence. 5. ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE. Knowing that one’s plans are sound, based upon experience or observation, encourages persistence. Guessing, instead of knowing, destroys persistence. 6. COOPERATION. Sympathy, understanding, and harmonious cooperation with others tend to develop persistence. 7. WILL POWER. The habit of concentrating one’s thoughts upon the building of plans for the attainment of a definite purpose leads to persistence. 8. HABIT. Persistence is the direct result of habit. The mind absorbs and becomes a part of the daily experiences upon which it feeds. Fear, the worst of all enemies, can be effectively cured by forced repetition of acts of courage. Everyone who has seen active service in war knows this. Before leaving the subject of PERSISTENCE, take inventory of yourself and determine in what particular, if any, you are lacking in this essential quality. Measure yourself courageously, point by point, and see how many of the Eight Factors of Persistence you lack. The analysis may lead to discoveries that will give you a new grip on yourself.

The human mind responds to stimuli, through which it may be “keyed up” to high rates of vibration known as enthusiasm, Creative Imagination, intense desire, and so forth. The ten stimuli to which the mind responds most freely are: 1. the desire for sexual expression 2. love 3. a burning desire for fame, power, or financial gain—MONEY 4. music 5. close friendship between either those of the same sex or those of the opposite sex 6. a Master Mind Alliance based upon the harmony of two or more people who ally themselves for spiritual or temporal advancement 7. mutual suffering, such as that experienced by people who are persecuted 8. autosuggestion 9. fear 10. narcotics and alcohol The desire for sexual expression comes at the head of the list of stimuli which most effectively step up the vibrations of the mind and, thus, “start the wheels” of physical action. Eight of these stimuli are natural and constructive. Two are destructive. The list is here presented for the purpose of enabling you to make a comparative study of the major sources of mind stimulation. From this study it will be readily seen that the emotion of sex is, by great odds, the most intense and powerful of all mind stimuli.

For example, the scientific inventor operating in the genius mode begins an invention by organizing and combining known ideas, or principles accumulated through experience, through the synthetic faculty (the reasoning faculty). If this accumulated knowledge turns out to be insufficient for the completion of the invention, the scientific inventor then draws upon the other sources of knowledge that are made available through the creative faculty. The exact method by which this is accomplished varies with the individual, but this is the sum and substance of the procedure that genius inventors use:

Criminologists have discovered that some of the most hardened criminals can be reformed through the influence of a strong love. There is no record of a criminal’s having been reformed solely through the influence of sex. These facts are well known, but their cause is not. Reformation comes, if at all, through the heart, or the emotional side, not through the head, or the reasoning side. Reformation means, “a change of heart.” It does not mean a “change of head.” A person may, because of reason, make certain changes in his or her personal conduct to avoid the consequences of undesirable effects, but GENUINE REFORMATION comes only through a change of heart—through a DESIRE to change.

THERE IS NO OTHER ROAD TO GENIUS THAN THROUGH VOLUNTARY SELF EFFORT! Individuals may, for a time, attain great heights of financial, business, or other achievement solely by the driving force of sex energy, but history is filled with evidence that such people may, and usually do, carry with them certain traits of character which rob them of the ability to either keep or enjoy their fortune. This is worthy of analysis, thought, and meditation, for it states a truth, the knowledge of which may be helpful to all men and women.

Something that will be very hard to resist is to tell yourself that you must act on something immediately and interrupt your task. This is rarely the truth. To combat this urge, set aside a Post-it to take notes for ideas that will inevitably spring to mind regarding other tasks. Just jot them down quickly and return to your primary goal. You can address them after your singletasking period is over, and you won’t have forgotten anything. It will keep your mind focused on one single task while setting you up for future success.

da upotrebi gospodina Vimpera da medju ljudima stvori suprotan utisak. Do sada su zivotinje imale malo ili nimalo dodira sa Vimperom tokom njegovih nedeljnih poseta; medjutim, sada su retke i pazljivo izabrane zivotinje, uglavnom ovce, dobile nalog da uzgredno pominju pred njim kako su sledovanja povecana. Pored toga, Napoleon je

Napoleon je delovao brzo i nemilosrdno. Naredio je da se kokoskama ukinu sledovanja hrane, i proglasio da ce svaka zivotinja koja da nekoj kokoski makar i zrno zita biti kaznjena smrcu. Psi

zivotinje su bile toliko uznemirene da su jedva mogle da spavaju u svojim stalama. Receno je da se on svake noci prikradao sakriven tamom i izvodio razne nepodopstine. Krao je kukuruz, obarao kante s mlekom, lomio jaja, gazio leje u povrtnjaku i glodao koru na stablima voca. Kad god bi nesto krenulo po zlu, postao je obicaj da se to pripise Snesku. Ako bi se polomio prozor ili zapusio odvod, neko bi obavezno rekao kako je Snesko dosao po noci i to uradio, a kada je izgubljen kljuc od skladisne supe, citava farma je bila uverena da ga je Snesko bacio u bunar. Veoma cudno je bilo to sto su, i kada je izgubljeni kljuc pronadjen ispod vrece brasna, zivotinje i dalje nastavile da veruju u to. Krave su jednoglasno tvrdile da se Snesko uvlacio u njihove stale i muzao ih dok su spavale. Za pacove, koji su te zime izazivali dosta nevolje, receno je da su i oni u savezu sa Sneskom.

Drugovi!” vikao je Skicalo, poskakujuci u mestu sitnim i nervoznim skokovima, otkriveno je nesto uzasno. Snesko se prodao Frederiku sa farme Ocupana livada, koji kuje zaveru da nas napadne i otme nam farmu! Snesko ce mu biti vodic kada napad pocne. Ali ima nesto jos gore od toga. Mislili smo da je razlog Sneskove pobune bila jednostavno njegova tastina i ambicija. Ali gresili smo, drugovi. Znate li sta je bio pravi razlog? Snesko je bio u savezu sa Dzonsom od samog pocetka! On je sve vreme bio Dzonsov tajni agent. Sve je to dokazano dokumentima koje je ostavio za sobom, a koje smo tek sada pronasli. Ovo po mom misljenju objasnjava mnogo toga, drugovi. Zar nismo i sami videli kako je pokusavao na svu srecu, bezuspesno da nas odvede u poraz i unistenje u Bici kod kravlje stale?”

zivotinje su bile prenerazene. Ovo je bila pokvarenost koja je daleko prevazilazila Sneskovo rusenje vetrenjace. Ali proslo je nekoliko minuta pre nego sto su mogle da u potpunosti shvate znacenje onoga sto im je receno. Sve su se one secale, ili su mislile da se secaju, kako su videle Sneska da jurisa ispred njih u Bici kod kravlje stale, kako ih je okupljao i hrabrio u svakom jurisu, i kako nije ni na trenutak zastao, cak ni kada su ga meci iz Dzonsove puske ranili u ledja. Na pocetku im je bilo pomalo tesko da uvide kako se ovo poklapa s tvrdnjom da je on bio na Dzonsovoj strani. cak je i Bokser, koji je retko postavljao pitanja, bio zbunjen. On je skupio prednje noge ispod sebe, legao na njih, sklopio oci i uz veliki napor uspeo da uoblici svoje misli.

Kad bi ona sama imala ikakvu sliku buducnosti, to bi bilo drustvo zivotinja oslobodjenih gladi i bica, drustvo ravnopravnih zivotinja, u kome svaka od njih radi u skladu sa svojim mogucnostima, one jake stite slabe, kao sto je ona stitila poslednje leglo pacica svojom prednjom nogom u noci Majorovog govora. Umesto toga ona nije znala zasto stigli su do toga da se niko nije usudjivao da kaze sta misli, da svuda lutaju strasni, iskezeni psi, i da moras da gledas kako tvoje drugove kidaju na komade nakon sto su priznali svoje neverovatne zlocine. U njenoj glavi nije bilo pomisli o neposlusnosti ili pobuni. Znala je da je sada, cak i ovako kako stvari stoje, daleko bolje nego sto je bilo u Dzonsovo vreme, i da je pre svega neophodno spreciti povratak ljudskih bica. sta god se desilo ona ce ostati verna, raditi vredno, izvrsavati

Nekoliko dana potom, kada je uzas izazvan pogubljenjima minuo, neke od zivotinja su se setile ili bar pomislile da su se setile da je sesta zapovest glasila ,,Nijedna zivotinja nece ubiti drugu zivotinju.” I mada niko nije bio bas spreman da to pominje pred svinjama ili psima, postojao je utisak da se ubistva koja su se odigrala ne uklapaju sa njom. Klover je zatrazila od Bendzamina da joj procita sestu zapovest, a kada je Bendzamin kao i obicno rekao da nece da se petlja u takve stvari, povela je sa sobom Mjuriel. Mjuriel joj je procitala Zapovest. Glasila je ovako: „Nijedna zivotinja nece ubiti drugu zivotinju bez razloga.” Iz nekog razloga, poslednje dve reci bile su iscilele iz pamcenja zivotinja. Ali one su sada videle da Zapovest nije bila prekrsena; posto je ocigledno postojao dobar razlog da se ubiju izdajnici koji su se udruzili sa Sneskom

dvesta posto, trista posto, ili petsto posto, u zavisnosti od slucaja do slucaja. zivotinje nisu videle razloga da mu ne veruju, pogotovo zbog toga sto vise nisu mogle sasvim jasno da se sete kakvi su uslovi zivota bili pre Pobune. Svejedno, bilo je dana kada su osecale kako bi radije da imaju manje brojki a vise hrane.

Ovo je bila puka legenda koju je negde posle Bitke kod kravlje stale prosirio sam Snesko. Daleko od toga da je bio odlikovan, on je zapravo bio prekoren zbog kukavicluka koji je pokazao u bici. Ponovo su to neke zivotinje slusale sa izvesnom zbunjenoscu, ali Skicalo je uskoro uspeo da ih ubedi kako ih pamcenje lose sluzi. U jesen, uz ogroman

Dva dana kasnije, zivotinje su sazvane na vanredni sastanak u stali. Zanemele su od iznenadjenja kad je Napoleon obznanio da je prodao gomilu drvne gradje Frederiku. Sutra ce stici Frederikova kola i poceti da je odvoze. Za sve vreme svog prividnog prijateljstva sa Pilkingtonom, Napoleon je zapravo bio u tajnom sporazumu sa Frederikom.

Svi odnosi sa Lisicijom sumom su prekinuti; Pilkingtonu su poslate uvredljive poruke. Golubovima je receno da izbegavaju farmu Ocupano polje i zamene parolu „Smrt Frederiku” sa „Smrt Pilkingtonu.” Istovremeno je Napoleon ubedjivao zivotinje da su price o predstojecem napadu na zivotinjsku farmu bile potpuno neistinite, a price o Frederikovoj okrutnosti prema njegovim zivotinjama u ogromnoj meri preuvelicane. Sve te glasine verovatno su poticale od Sneska i njegovih agenata. Sada je izgledalo da se on, uostalom, i ne krije na Ocupanom polju, i da zapravo nikada u zivotu nije bio tamo; on je ziveo u prilicnoj raskosi, kako je receno u Lisicijoj sumi, i u stvarnosti ga je godinama unazad placao Pilkington

U aprilu, Zivotinjska farma je proglasena republikom, i nastala je potreba da se izabere predsednik. Postojao je samo jedan kandidat, Napoleon, i izabran je jednoglasno. Istog dana je saopsteno da su pronadjeni novi dokumenti koji su otkrili dodatne pojedinosti o Sneskovoj povezanosti sa Dzonsom. Sada je izgledalo da Snesko nije, kao sto su zivotinje ranije mislile, prosto pokusavao da izgubi Bitku kod kravlje stale pomocu ratnog lukavstva, nego se otvoreno borio na Dzonsovoj strani. Zapravo, on je bio taj koji je predvodio ljudske snage, i jurisao je u bitku sa recima „zivelo covecanstvo!” na usnama. Rane na Sneskovim ledjima, kojih se nekoliko zivotinja jos secalo da ih je videlo, nanete su Napoleonovim zubima

Rekao je da je cuo kako je u vreme Bokserovog odlaska kruzila jedna glupa i zlobna glasina. Neke od zivotinja su primetile da je na kolima koja su odvezla Boksera pisalo „Klanica konja” i da su zaista brzopleto zakljucile da je Bokser poslat klanicaru. Skoro je neverovatno, rekao je Skicalo, da ijedna zivotinja moze da bude toliko glupa. Svakako, viknuo je zgrozeno, uvrcuci repom i poskakujuci u stranu, svi oni dovoljno dobro poznaju svog voljenog Vodju, druga Napoleona? Ali objasnjenje je zaista bilo vrlo jednostavno. Kola su nekada pripadala kasapinu, a kupio ih je veterinar, koji jos nije obojio stari natpis na njima. Tako je doslo da zabune

Te noci se culo gromoglasno pevanje, posle cega je sledilo nesto nalik na zestoku svadju, koja se zavrsila oko jedanaest sati strasnom lomljavom stakla. Sutradan se niko u farmerskoj kuci nije ni pomerio do podneva, i proculo se da su svinje negde dosle do novca da sebi kupe jos jedan sanduk viskija
